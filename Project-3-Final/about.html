    <h2>Hello</h2>
    <p>I would like to introduce myself. My name is Elizabeth, but you can call me Beth. I am a wife to a very talented man and mom of six awesome children. I have spent the last 17 years raising and educating my children and seeking to make a postive impact in the world I live in. I have been blessed to have the opportunity to be an intergral part of my children's daily lives as they are growing up and experiencing the world around them. This has been one of my greatest adventures and most powerful learning experiences.
