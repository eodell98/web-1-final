    <h2>Mentor</h2>
    <p>Stop for a moment and think. Who has mentored you? I am sure you can think of several people in your life that have had an impact and made a difference in who you are today. Everyone needs mentors. Mentoring is a key part of teaching and leadership and makes us more empathetic. Not only have I benefited from being mentored, but have also received great joy from mentoring students, college age, young moms and families newer to homeschooling. At this point in my life, I love building up others to take a mentoring and shepherding role with those around them.</p>
