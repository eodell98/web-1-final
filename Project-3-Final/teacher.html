    <h2>Teacher</h2>
    <h4>"I wasn't born to teach. I was born to inspire others, to change people, and to never give up; even when faced with challenges that seem impossible."</h4>
    <p> I have been teaching kids since highschool. My first job was a preschool teacher, followed by being a swim instructor. I have taught young kids, middle schoolers, highschoolers and even adults. First and foremeost, I am a learner and a collaborator. I am to be passionate about whatever I am teaching: writing, math, geography, leadership or the Bible. My goal is to inspire those around me through whatever content I am teaching.</p>
